# pp-besm

Coder for PP-BESM programs as described by "Esrhov, A.P. _Programming Programme for the BESM Computer._ Translated by M. Nadler, Pergamon Press, 1959."

`pp-besm` includes a nifty feature that wasn't possible back in 1959, a parser for the source language! No more handwriting 39-bit binary to encode your program! It will output a file containing in which each 39-bit word is encoded in the bottom bits of a 64-bit (modern) word.
